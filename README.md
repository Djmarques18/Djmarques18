# 👋 Hey there, I'm Derrick!

I've got a background in hands-on craftsmanship and I've recently geared up in software engineering. 🚀

## 💡 My Journey

Started with garage remodeling, where I learned to nail the details and tackle tough problems. After working with polyaspartic coatings and cabinets, I've stepped into web development.

## 🌐 Skills and Learning

Recently wrapped up the USF Software Engineering Bootcamp, picking up skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, React, Python, SQL, and Node.js. Now, as of January 2024, I'm ready to jump into software engineering challenges.

## 🛠️ My Approach

It's not just coding for me. I'm about blending hands-on craftsmanship with technical coding skills. I'm all about building clean, smart solutions and I'm excited to work on software projects that count.
